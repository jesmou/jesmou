<h1>A community of self-learning web developers</h1>

👋 Hi, I’m Jesper and I helped start <a href="https://buildfaast.com">the BuildFaast community</a>. 

🌱 We're a community of web developers who enjoy tackling new projects and tutorials together. We often give up when we go at it alone, but working together gives us a sense of community to improving our dev skills.

<h2>Join our community!</h2>

💞️ We run cohorts around web development fundamentals and frameworks, and we're always open to new ideas.

👀 Come <a href="https://discord.gg/2AKB6nKUmE">say hi on Discord</a> if you're interested in joining us!
